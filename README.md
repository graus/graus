### Hi, I'm David Graus

I'm an Assistant Professor in IR & NLP at the [Institute for Logic, Language, and Computation (ILLC)](https://www.illc.uva.nl/) at the [University of Amsterdam](https://www.uva.nl/en), and Lab Manager of the [ICAI OpenGov Lab](https://opengov.nl/). I worked in industry positions before returning to academia, most recently working on search and recommender systems in news and HR. I also worked extensively on research and practical approaches to fair and ethical AI. You can read more about my views on responsible AI [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/forget-the-trolley-problem-pragmatic-and-fair-ai-in-the-real-world-350dc1e77f3f) and learn more about me on my [about page](https://graus.nu/about/).
